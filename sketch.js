Khorisa Maas recipe :

Ingredients:

• 5-6 pieces of Rahu fish (one may use other fishes too)
• About 100 gm grated bamboo shoots (pickled, fermented or raw)
• Two-three tablespoon oil depending on the type of pan you’re using
• One-two medium-sized tomato (cut into small pieces)
• Two green chillies
• 1/4th teaspoon white mustard seeds
• Salt to taste

Method:

Marinate the fish pieces with turmeric, salt and a dash of oil for half an hour/one hour. Pour the oil in a 
pan and fry the fish pieces (not too deep). Set them aside. A lot of people use ginger garlic paste in this 
preparation but since i prefers the undiluted taste of khorisa, I did not use any. In the remaining oil
 (shouldn’t be more than one teaspoon), add the mustard seeds. When they splutter, add the tomatoes. Add the 
 salt, turmeric, and green chillies. In the mean time, mix the khorisa (I have used khorisa pickle) with some
  water, and set aside One may even use the grated bamboo shoots in raw or fermented form. However your
  cooking procedure will differ depending on how you’re using the khorisa When the tomatoes go pulpy, add hot 
  water. As the gravy thickens a bit, add the fish pieces. Soon add the khorisa mixture to the preparation. 
  Heat for some time and your ‘khorisa maas’ is ready.
